[Cairn](https://cairn.xng.pw)
=====

Introduction
------------

A static site generator CMS that's like no other. Generates static HTML files to serve quickly and efficiently.
With an administration area (that's right). Oh, and it's also themeable.
Cairn is also huge on usability. A great backend design. Pages in GitHub flavoured Mardown.

**At 20KB zipped (core files), it doesn't need an explanation.**

Demo
----

You can access a running version of Cairn at http://cairn.lfred.info  
However, for security reasons, the backend is closed off (you can [download Cairn](https://github.com/alfredxing/cairn/archive/master.zip) if you want to test it out).

Documentation & Theming

[We've put up docs](https://github.com/alfredxing/cairn/wiki/Documentation) for all of you to check out.

No databases!
